# random-strings

A simple command-line utility to randomly generate strings (or groups of strings) of a given length. Mostly written for my own use in testing solutions to problems at [http://rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info), but the sky is the limit.

Requires `argparse`, `random`, and `string` (all of which are native Python modules).
